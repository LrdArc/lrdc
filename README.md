- Make sure you have apache mod_rewrite enabled.
- Place any static file (.css/.js or images) on "static" folder; the html on "views" folder but using .php extension.
- You just need to access with file's name to open it on browser.
- For example, you have about.php placed on "views" in your localhost, open "localhost/about/" on your browser.
- Or you can make your custom url on "config/controller.php"
- You need to edit "config/config.php" on your own.
